     Ans: 
          1. When we write in binary of that number then it contain only one 1

   	we need to find no.of bits in O(1)
   	1. make use of previously calculated thing ans[i] = ans[i / 2]
   	2. Even and odd status helps us update, finally ans[i] = ans[i / 2] + i % 2

# NOTE POINTS:
  
  <pre>
  * Built in functions:
      b._Find_first();          Returns the position of 1st set bit
      b.__builtin_popcount();   Returns the number of 1's in that number
      b.to_string();            Convert to string
      b.to_ulong();             Convert to decimal
     
  * Signed and Unsigned:
   The rel between signed and unsigned is signed number -x = Unsigned number 2^n - x
                          ~x=-x-1
                         Min                 Max

      2.UnSigned num      0                  2^(n-1)-1
