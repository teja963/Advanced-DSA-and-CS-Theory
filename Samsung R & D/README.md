# Tips and Approaches
<pre>
  <b>DFS: If we know the starting point or don't know which point we need to choose</b>
  Use dfs for checking all possibilities, such that recursion tree height as base
  Use struct for storing multiple components
  Keep track of visited node or point

<pre> 
 <b>BFS: When source and destination given known or use bfs</b>
  use normal queue for equal importance for each step
  otherwise use priority queue for un-equal steps based on wgt or cost
  Use struct for storing multiple components
