Mr. Sam. Sung Choi has to do a marathon of D distance. He has a max health H.
He can run in 5 different paces. Paces are given as how much minutes and seconds and health
does it require to complete 1km in this pace.
e.g: pace 1: 6 19 16 (mm ss health)
means, if mr. Choi runs in pace 1, it takes 6 mins 19 secs to cover 1km and it costs 
a health of 16 units from the total health.
Find the min time required to finish the race.
print the ans in this format: #T mm ss (e.g: #1 137 20)

Input format: 
no of tc: T
distance of marathon: D
Total Health: H
