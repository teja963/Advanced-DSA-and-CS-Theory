/*
There are N fishing spots and 3 gates. At each gate there are some fishermen waiting to reach the nearest unoccupied fishing spot. (Total no of fisherman <=N)

Distance between consecutive spots = distance between gate and nearest spot = 1 m

Only 1 gate can be opened(other gates after that gate) at a time and all fishermen of that gate must occupy the spots before the next gate is opened.

Distance is calculated as gate to nearest spot + nearest spot to closest vacant spot. Find the total sum of minimum distances need to walk for all the fishermen.
