/*
A Research team want to establish a research center in a region where they found some rare-elements.
They want to make it closest to all the rare-elements as close as possible so that they can reduce
overall cost of research over there. It is given that all the rare-elementâ€™s location is connected
by roads. It is also given that Research Center can only be build on road. Team decided to assign
this task to a coder. If you feel you have that much potential.
Here is the Task :- Find the shortest of the longest distance of research center from given locations
of rare-elements.
Locations are given in the matrix cell form where 1 represents roads and 0 no road. 
Number of rare-element and their location was also given(number<=5) and order of square matrix
was less than equal to (20).
*/
/*
For this you have to implement bfs for every position where road exist to find the distance of 
every research center or do Vice-versa. for each position store maximum distance of all distances
to research center and the compare each maximum distance to find minimum of them
