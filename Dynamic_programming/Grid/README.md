   <b>key points:</b>
   going from top to bottom or bottom to top is same
   consider bottom starting simultaneously
   r1 + c1 = r2 + c2 
   <b>cases</b>
   1. Both are at same point pick up one
   2. Both are at different points choose both
   3. choose next all possible(2*2) move and take max add to the previous pickup. Meanwhile in 2nd model its 3*3
   4. store the values in 3D dp(by column changing pattern)
