### Checking
 <pre>
 <b>Array and integers</b>
 while arthemetic operators check abt constraints
 if numbers check +ve, -ve, 0 and size_limit
 for solving problems check the case of 
 <b>Integers values limit, duplicates(check need to avoid or include case)</b>
   
 <b>Strings</b>
 check about the what kind of chars it involved and size, any leading or trailing spaces
 </pre>
   	
### Approach
  <div>
  If you have devised a method, first observe the base case (or smaller test cases) and check if it works.<br>
  Let's take a small example: 
    <h4>Factorial</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Made the algorithm? ➡️ Go to base case. </li>
      <li>Check if it works for the base case (like n=1 or n=0 in this case) </li>
      <li>Fails? ➡️ Try again! <b>Not giving up is the key!</b> </li>
      <li>Pass? ➡️ Try bigger examples or perhaps submit the code on the platform that you might be using for practice (like <a href="https://geeksforgeeks.org/">GFG</a> or <a href="https//:leetcode.com">Leetcode</a>)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
### Keypoints
  <pre>Use memset for filling 0 or 1 in an array, and it won't work for any other values
  	you can use <b>fill(begin(a), end(a), any value)</b>  </pre>
