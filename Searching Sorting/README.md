   log n means binary search with l = 0 and h = 5*n
   high = mid
   low = mid+1(at least)
   so return low

# Binary search Approach
  <pre>
  <b><a href="https://github.com/teja963/Advanced-DSA/tree/master/Searching%20Sorting">Minimum number in sorted array</a></b>
  use binary search and check mid and high conditions
